# CALCULATOR
I'm really excited to tell you that I'm pursuing my internship at CODSOFT company under the domain of WEB DEVELOPMENT...
.
This is my current TASK 3 in LEVEL 1 in CODSOFT to create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JAVA SCRIPT, I have created this to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.
.
This calculator have a display screen to show user inputs and results. I have utilised CSS grid systems for button alignments. I have used event listeners, if - else statements, operators, and loops to handle user inputs and perform calculations.
.
I have completed this project with more resources over internet and unforgettable experience in building these relevant projects.
